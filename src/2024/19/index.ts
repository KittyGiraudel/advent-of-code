  // caching in the solution. I eventually took inspiration from a version found
  // on Reddit.
  // The logic is quite simple in the end (and very similar to the one I used in
  // my original version): for a given pattern, find the towels that fit at the
  // beginning of it, and then recursively do that, slicing off the length of
  // said towel so that caching can be leveraged.
