// My solution uses my double-ended queue library. That being said, it is not
// better than using arrays considering the volume weâ€™re dealing with. A linked
// list would be better if we had so many items that storing such a huge array
// in memory wouldnâ€™t work. We only have 5,000 items here, so an array would
// most likely be better but Iâ€™m keeping this solution for posterity (still runs
// within 2 seconds).

// Side note, kudos to that solution which is much simpler and faster:
